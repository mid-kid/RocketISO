RocketISO
=========

RocketISO is a collection of scripts I use to build a bootable linux
distribution based on my current main system and configuration. It serves as
a sort of usable equivalent of a "desktop screenshot", a time capsule to look
back on.

**Current release:** [RocketISO 2024](docs/RELEASE-2024.md)

See also [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for an overview of how these scripts are used.
