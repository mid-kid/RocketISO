<p class="Pp">Welcome to my little corner of the cyberspace. This live system
    that you're using right now is my day to day, though I've tidied the place
    up a little before inviting you over. I hope you don't mind its spartan

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATIONS">APPLICATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There's a lot of things installed in this system, and I can't
    possibly cover all of them. However, I do want to highlight a few that are
    special to me, be that because I configured them extensively or because they
    fit well in my workflow.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Firefox"><a class="permalink" href="#Firefox">Firefox</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The firefox installation on this system has been heavily
    configured. It primarily just consists of two components:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent Bl-compact">
  <li>Arkenfox user.js</li>
  <li>Lepton theme (photon style)</li>
</ul>
And a script to install these (in
  <span class="Pa">~/.dotfiles/zzz-firefox</span>). It also comes with a
  selection of addons currently installed on my system, some of which
  preconfigured.
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Vim"><a class="permalink" href="#Vim">Vim</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Kind of goes without saying. I use this program practically
    without thinking at this point. Some people will find that my configuration
    is light on the IDE-like features, like automatic linting, a
    context-sensitive autocomplete, or good code navigation features. I
    sometimes use
    <a class="permalink" href="#ctags"><b class="Sy" id="ctags">ctags</b></a> to
    navigate big codebases, as it provides &quot;jump to reference&quot;
    functionality, but I find that I rarely miss features like that. This is my
    primary programming editor on any system I use.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Zim"><a class="permalink" href="#Zim">Zim</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">My de-facto notetaing tool. While I've been considering
    alernatives like
    <a class="permalink" href="#Qownnotes"><b class="Sy" id="Qownnotes">Qownnotes</b></a>,
    and I sometimes edit the files in <b class="Sy">Vim</b> instead, this is the
    tool I always keep coming back to. It's simple and straight to the point,
    provides plenty of organization and bookkeeping features, and can render
    into various formats suitable for sharing.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Teeworlds"><a class="permalink" href="#Teeworlds">Teeworlds</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Probably the most addicting jump-and-shoot game in the free
    software market. A real oldie, that I've always kept around for the
    occasional play.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Qalculate!"><a class="permalink" href="#Qalculate!">Qalculate!</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A diamond in the rough and one of the newest programs I've been
    trying to add to my workflow, to replace using the
    <a class="permalink" href="#python"><b class="Sy" id="python">python</b></a>
    shell as a calculator all the time. While it's not the best programming
    calculator, with its hex and bin modes being just a bit too inconvenient,
    when you involve any form of units and unit conversions it's an absolute
    beast. For someone that has trouble doing mental math, it's a godsent.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Firejail"><a class="permalink" href="#Firejail">Firejail</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is my coping mechanism for when I want/need to run
    proprietary software that I'm not willing to trust. These days I'm
    considering alternatives like
    <a class="permalink" href="#Flatpak"><b class="Sy" id="Flatpak">Flatpak</b></a>,
    though I dread dealing with its package management story. My bespoke
    configuration lives in <span class="Pa">~/.config/firejail</span>, though
    the few programs that need it in this live system have already been set
  up.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pass"><a class="permalink" href="#pass">pass</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A password manager. While not really useful in this live session,
    it's the one that convinced me to take the plunge. It's really easy to set
    up, provides great integration with both my browser and the rest of my
    system (through
    <a class="permalink" href="#passff"><b class="Sy" id="passff">passff</b></a>
    and
    <a class="permalink" href="#rofi-pass"><b class="Sy" id="rofi-pass">rofi-pass</b></a>),
    and has a problemless synchronization story due to using git (provided you
    have a trustworthy git/ssh server). The android app is also excellent.
    Unfortunately, it's a bit lacking on Windows, and not super tight in
    security (though anything's better than bad passwords!), so in the future I
    might consider
    <a class="permalink" href="#KeePassXC"><b class="Sy" id="KeePassXC">KeePassXC</b></a>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="nsxiv"><a class="permalink" href="#nsxiv">nsxiv</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Currently one of the best out of the &quot;simple&quot; image

<h2 class="Ss" id="keychain"><a class="permalink" href="#keychain">keychain</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">I once installed this when I had trouble setting up my ssh agent
    for temporary key persistence, and have never touched it since. It's one of
    those set and forget kind of deals, and it even handles the gpg agent
    without extra configuration. I'm not even sure what it does exactly, but
    whatever it does it's working great.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A few applications have been hidden from the application launcher,
    to avoid cluttering the interface a little bit too much. These may be
    applications that are already autostarted by
    <span class="Pa">~/.config/i3/autostart</span>, require extra configuration
    to function, are otherwise already accessible through a different method, or
    any other reason.</p>
<p class="Pp">The removed applications can be found by using:</p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">grep NoDisplay
  ~/.local/share/applications/*.desktop</code></div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MOTIVATION"><a class="permalink" href="#MOTIVATION">MOTIVATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of this system is twofold. First, I want to show my
    setup to people, in a way that doesn't require tedious installation
    instructions and actual commitment. I've tended to my custom scripts,
    patches and configurations for just about a decade now, and this ride has
    only grown wilder when I started using Slackware, and later Gentoo, to the
    point I have plenty of things that I'm sure others would find interesting.
    It may not be the most screenshot-worthy setup, but I hope this'll give you
    some ideas to go off of, or you find some tools or programs to install for
    yourself. Secondly, I want to take a snapshot. Like a picture of my house
    when I was a lad, I want to be able to look back on this. The GNU/Linux
    ecosystem keeps changing, causing things to break, and me to solve problems
    differently. It's also a crystallization of the programs and games I liked
    or used at the time.</p>
