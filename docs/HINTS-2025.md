This document lists some interesting things you can do in this live system. Some of it is unique to this system, some of it is just general linux stuff.

Make sure you didn't miss the banners, and welcome messages. Use Super+d and read the [README](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mid-kid/RocketISO/master/docs/README-2025.html)!

* The basics:
    * `sl`
    * `btop`
    * `neofetch`
* `firefox about:addons`
* Look through the application menu (Super+d) for some games
* Create a QR code and view it: `qrencode foobar -s 10 -o -|display`
    * Scan it by pressing the "Print Screen" key
* Expose current directory on http: `webfsd -d`
* Try playing Osu! with your touchpad: `osu-xinput-mode`
