RocketISO
=========

RocketISO is a collection of scripts I use to build a bootable linux
distribution based on my current main system and configuration. It serves as
a sort of usable equivalent of a "desktop screenshot", a time capsule to look
back on.

Check out the [Releases](releases) page for more information.
