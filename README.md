RocketISO
=========

RocketISO is a collection of scripts I use to build a bootable linux
distribution based on my current main system and configuration. It serves as a
sort of bootable equivalent of a "desktop screenshot", and a time capsule to
look back on.

**Current release:** [RocketISO 2025](docs/RELEASE-2025.md)

See also [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for an overview of how these scripts are used.
