<p class="Pp">Welcome! You found my personal corner of the internet, I'm happy
    to have you! The live system that you're using right now is my day to day,
    though I've tidied up the place a little before inviting you over. I hope
    that this guide will help make you feel right at home.</p>

<p class="Pp">Press &#x27E8;Super+Enter&#x27E9; to open a terminal window. Press
    &#x27E8;Super+Shift+q&#x27E9; to close any window.</p>
<p class="Pp">To change the keyboard layout, right-click the keyboard icon in
    the system tray or run <code class="Ic">fcitx-configtool</code> in a
    terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The system language may be changed by using
    <code class="Ic">rocket-setlang en_US.utf8</code> and logging out and back
    in with &#x27E8;Super+Control+p.&#x27E9; Similarly, you may change the DPI
    settings (set to 1.25% by default) by using <code class="Ic">rocket-setdpi
    96</code> and logging out and back in.</p>
<p class="Pp">Press &#x27E8;Super+d&#x27E9; to open the application launcher.
    Here you'll find a semi-organized list of cool applications. Type to filter
    or use the arrow keys to navigate and press enter to launch an application.
    Press &#x27E8;Super+Tab&#x27E9; to switch panels.</p>
<p class="Pp">You'll find the vast amount of user configuration files in
    <span class="Pa">~/.dotfiles</span>, and system configuration and patches
    mostly reside in <span class="Pa">/etc/portage</span>.</p>

  TO THE INTERNET</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">RocketISO has a bit of an uncommon network configuration. It uses
    openrc's excellent netifrc subsystem, which functions like magic by default:
    It selects the right tools to perform the connection depending on what is
    installed, and what network adapter is being used.</p>
<p class="Pp">In more practical terms, ethernet connections will be managed
    using ifplugd, and once plugged in will launch dhcpcd. No further
    configuration is required to connect.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wireless connections will be managed using wpa_supplicant, and
    once connected will launch dhcpcd as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">To connect to a wireless network, a GUI tool is provided, called
    wpaCute. You can use it as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ol class="Bl-enum Bl-compact">
  <li>Locate the Wireless icon in the system tray and click on it, or launch it
      in the terminal as <code class="Ic">wpa-cute</code>.</li>
  <li>Near the top, click on &quot;Scan&quot;. Give it a second to collect
      networks.</li>
  <li>Double-click your network, type your password, and press &quot;Add&quot;.
      Close the &quot;Scan Results&quot; window.</li>
  <li>In the &quot;Networks&quot; tab, select your network and press
      &quot;Enable&quot;. Save the configuration using
      &#x27E8;Control+s.&#x27E9;</li>
  <li>The network should now be connected.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Pp">There's a lot of things installed in this system, and I can't
    possibly cover all of them. However, I do want to highlight a few that are
    special to me, be that because I configured them extensively or because they
    fit well in my workflow.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Firefox"><a class="permalink" href="#Firefox">Firefox</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The firefox installation on this system has been heavily
    configured. It primarily just consists of two components:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent Bl-compact">
  <li>Arkenfox user.js</li>
  <li>Lepton theme (photon style)</li>
</ul>
And a script to install these (in
  <span class="Pa">~/.dotfiles/zzz-firefox</span>). It also comes with all the
  addons currently installed on my system.
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Vim"><a class="permalink" href="#Vim">Vim</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Kind of goes without saying. I use this program practically
    without thinking at this point. Some people will find that my configuration
    is light on the IDE-like features, like automatic linting, a
    context-sensitive autocomplete, or good code navigation features. I
    sometimes use
    <a class="permalink" href="#ctags"><b class="Sy" id="ctags">ctags</b></a> to
    navigate big codebases, as it provides &quot;jump to reference&quot;
    functionality, but I find that I rarely miss features like that. This is my
    primary programming editor on any system I use.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Zim"><a class="permalink" href="#Zim">Zim</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">My de-facto notetaing tool. While I've been considering
    alernatives like
    <a class="permalink" href="#Qownnotes"><b class="Sy" id="Qownnotes">Qownnotes</b></a>,
    and I sometimes edit the files in <b class="Sy">Vim</b> instead, this is the
    tool I always keep coming back to. It's simple and straight to the point,
    provides plenty of organization and bookkeeping features, and can render
    into various formats suitable for sharing.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Teeworlds"><a class="permalink" href="#Teeworlds">Teeworlds</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Probably the most addicting jump-and-shoot game in the free
    software market. A real oldie, that I've always kept around for the
    occasional play.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Osu!"><a class="permalink" href="#Osu!">Osu!</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The game I've arguably put most time in, ever. It's a rhythm game
    with a massive community, tonnes of maps, good multiplayer and a healthy
    leaderboard. I've included some songs with this distribution. See
    <a class="Sx" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a> about latency.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Qalculate!"><a class="permalink" href="#Qalculate!">Qalculate!</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A diamond in the rough and one of the newest programs I've been
    trying to add to my workflow, to replace using the
    <a class="permalink" href="#python"><b class="Sy" id="python">python</b></a>
    shell as a calculator all the time. While it's not the best programming
    calculator, with its hex and bin modes being just a bit too inconvenient,
    when you involve any form of units and unit conversions it's an absolute
    beast. For someone that has trouble doing mental math, it's a godsent.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Firejail"><a class="permalink" href="#Firejail">Firejail</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is my coping mechanism for when I want/need to run
    proprietary software that I'm not willing to trust. These days I'm
    considering alternatives like
    <a class="permalink" href="#Flatpak"><b class="Sy" id="Flatpak">Flatpak</b></a>,
    though I dread dealing with its package management story. My bespoke
    configuration lives in <span class="Pa">~/.config/firejail</span>, and the
    few programs using it in this live system have already been configured.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pass"><a class="permalink" href="#pass">pass</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A password manager. While not really useful in this live session,
    it's the one that convinced me to try a password manager at all. It's really
    easy to set up, provides great integration with both my browser and the rest
    of my system (through
    <a class="permalink" href="#passff"><b class="Sy" id="passff">passff</b></a>
    and
    <a class="permalink" href="#rofi-pass"><b class="Sy" id="rofi-pass">rofi-pass</b></a>),
    and has a problemless synchronization story due to using git (provided you
    have a trustworthy git/ssh server). The android app is also excellent.
    Unfortunately, it's a bit lacking on Windows, and not super tight in
    security (though anything's better than bad passwords!), so in the future I
    might consider
    <a class="permalink" href="#KeePassXC"><b class="Sy" id="KeePassXC">KeePassXC</b></a>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="nsxiv"><a class="permalink" href="#nsxiv">nsxiv</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Currently one of the best out of the &quot;simple&quot; image
    viewers. Supports animated GIFs, a gallery view, and usage in arbitrary
    scripts as an image picker.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="keychain"><a class="permalink" href="#keychain">keychain</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">I once installed this when I has having trouble setting up my ssh
    agent for temporary key persistence, and have never touched it since. It's
    one of those programs that you set up and forget, and it even handles the
    gpg agent without extra configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The compositor used is
    <a class="permalink" href="#picom"><i class="Em" id="picom">picom</i></a>.
    While it usually works great, it may introduce graphical issues on some
    hardware, or increase latency in some games like
    <a class="Sx" href="#Osu!">Osu!</a>. To temporarily disable it, issue
    <code class="Ic">killall picom</code> in a terminal. If you wish to
    re-enable it after, use <code class="Ic">picom -b</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few applications have been hidden from the application launcher,
    to avoid cluttering the interface a little bit too much. These may be
    applications that are already autostarted by
    <span class="Pa">~/.config/i3/autostart</span>, require extra configuration
    to function, are otherwise already accessible through a different method, or
    any other reason.</p>
<p class="Pp">The removed applications can be found by using:</p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">grep NoDisplay
  ~/.local/share/applications/*.desktop</code></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MOTIVATION"><a class="permalink" href="#MOTIVATION">MOTIVATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of this system is twofold. First, I want to show my
    setup to people, in a way that doesn't require tedious installation
    instructions and actual commitment. I've tended to my custom scripts,
    patches and configurations for just over a decade now, and this ride has
    only grown wilder when I started using Slackware, and later Gentoo, to the
    point I have plenty of things that I'm sure others would find interesting.
    It may not be the most screenshot-worthy setup, but I hope this'll give you
    some ideas to go off of, or you find some tools or programs to install for
    yourself. Secondly, I want to take a snapshot, to be able to look back on
    this. The GNU/Linux ecosystem keeps changing, causing things to break, and
    me to solve problems differently. It's also a crystallization of the
    programs and games I liked or used at the time.</p>
